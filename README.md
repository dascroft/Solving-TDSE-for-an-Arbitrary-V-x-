# Solving the TDSE for a Arbitrary Potential V

Using tdse_solver.py, for a specified potention V(x), it is then solved outputting the solution to the Hamiltonian as a gif, saved to a desired path. 
The user can specify what function of V(x) they desire and specify the associated parameters, i.e $kx^2$, with parameters $k$ being the coefficent and $p$ being the power. Using the Crankâ€“Nicolson method, the wavefunction is then resolved within the specified potential and the default output is given as an animated 'output.gif'.

### Intructions for using the program:
Open a program capable of running `.py` files (to use command line, use Anaconda Powershell Prompt for best results.)
* For manual access: 
  * Open file `src\Python_code\solving_tdse.py` in the program of choice. 
  * To input values, scroll to the bottom and replace the "`args.XXX`" terms in  with the chosen values - use the contained "help" instructions above to determine which are which.
* For command line access:
  * From the program root folder, use `cd src\Python_code` to set the run location to the same folder as `tdse_cmd.py`.
  * Use command `python tdse_cmd.py` to run the file from command line - the program should create a new `.gif` file in `src\Python_code`.
  * To input new values, run `python tdse_cmd.py --help`, to have Powershell list all possible input variables. From there, input the desired variables in standard command line format. For example: 
```python
python tdse_cmd.py --vx "2*x**2"
```
The example above generates a $V(x) = 2x^2$ potential and the TDSE is solved within this potential, The ouputted solution can be represented as either a .gif or heat map plot directed by the user.
